# ML Linear Regression Project

This project was developed as part of the "Machine Learning from Data" course. It provides a hands-on implementation of **linear regression**, covering data preprocessing, model training using gradient descent, and performance evaluation.

## 📁 Files

- `notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with step-by-step instructions and explanations.
- `ml-linear-regression.py`: A Python script containing the core logic for preprocessing and training.

## 🚀 Features

- Mean normalization for feature scaling
- Manual implementation of the linear regression model
- Gradient descent optimization
- Computation of training and validation error (MSE)
- Code is designed to be efficient and vectorized using NumPy
